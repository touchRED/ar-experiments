# AR Knots

This repository contains code written for my final individual project in **ARGD 4080, Mathematics Outreach Design Lab**, in which I've found parameterizations for 6 different knots and visualized them in a traversable augmented reality space. To watch this app in action, take a look at the video [here](https://vimeo.com/267052680).

Below you'll find descriptions of the 6 knots I chose to display, as well as pictures. 

## Knot 1

![trefoil](img/trefoil.jpg)

A simple trefoil with 3 crossings.

## Knot 2

![figure 8](img/figure-eight.jpg)

A figure 8 knot with 4 crossings.

## Knot 3

![granny](img/granny.jpg)

The connected sum of two trefoils (otherwise known as a granny knot) with 6 crossings.

The last 3 knots all exist on the surface of a torus, differing by how many times they cross the meridian and longitudinal axis.

## Knot 4

![3-4 torus](img/three-four-torus.jpg)

A 3-4 torus (crossing meridian 3 times, longitudinal axis 4).

## Knot 5

![4-7 torus](img/four-seven-torus.jpg)

A 4-7 torus (crossing meridian 4 times, longitudinal axis 7).

## Knot 6

![6-11 torus](img/six-eleven-torus.jpg)

A 6-11 torus (crossing meridian 6 times, longitudinal axis 11).
