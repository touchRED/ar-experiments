# AR Experiments

I recently started investigating augmented reality design thanks to a new [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) addon, [ofxARKit](https://github.com/sortofsleepy/ofxARKit).

This repository is still very much in its early stages, but it’s growing every day as I learn something new. Normally I wouldn’t be too inclined to show something this rough, but I think it’s important to document my use of this technology since there aren’t really any educational resources yet.

If you have any questions about AR, openFrameworks, or using ofxARKit, please reach out!
